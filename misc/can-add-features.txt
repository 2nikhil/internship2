to-be-done

1)catch exceptions


5)values are storing as null--look into this issue
4)redirect after entering to previous page
6)pagination
7)efficient way to delete multiple rows in mysql


delete-exceptions/features need to be added--
1)when asset number is not there we cannot delete such since we are taking asset number ------ask him
   check these exceptions

2)when asset number is same all same asset numbers are being deleted becoz in mysql database  "delete" statement deletes all similar(same) valued things ----ask him

3)delete functionality has to be improved so much..check for corner cases

5)when anyone check box is unchecked select_all checkbox must be unchecked and alos if only one check box is there and is checked..then select_all checkbox must be checked.

6)only few assets are getting deleted when select_all is chosen ---problem found at ajax request--it is not sending quickly thats why once select-all chosen only few deletes and without refreshing again select_all chosen they are getting deleted. but if page is refreshed again same scenario repeated

---in backend autoincrment value is going like 101 102 even when all records were delered and freshly were being inserted (need to initilaized to 0)--(how to make sure it resets to 0 anb starts from there

---post is entering one asset as 2---check





update-----



2)update not working---"put" request in forms not working for only form submission.working from postman
