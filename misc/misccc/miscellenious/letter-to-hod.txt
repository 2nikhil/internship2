Sub: Request for CRT money back as I am going for internship.

Sir,

   I am persuing BE undergraduation about to enter final year. I have started doing my internship since june 20th which continues until august 10th. 
   Due to the start date of crt which is on 23rd of june, I cannot attend the coaching as I am not granted with time to attend it at college.
   So I kindly request you to return my crt amount 2000 Rs, which I paid during hall ticket issuing. I have submitted the call letter as a proof of my internship.

         thanking you,
	
							yours sincerely,
